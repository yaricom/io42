title: Psistats
subtitle: Psycho-demographic profiling of internet users
summary: The project had a goal to provide the working implementation of psycho-demographic profiling algorithm, which can be used to profile Internet users based on digital footprints they leave by using various Internet services. We provide full source code implementation in the R programming language of the algorithms described in the corresponding research paper.

The project had a goal to provide working implementation of psycho-demographic profiling algorithm which can be used to profile Internet users based on digital footprints they leave by using various Internet services. We provide full source code implementation in R programming language of the algorithms described in corresponding research paper.

We have used variety of machine learning and data mining tools in order to process input data corpus and to create artificial neural networks for multivariate regression analysis.
